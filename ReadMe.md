* Hoisting
* Function syntax
* Declaration/expression
* Being aware that functions can be stored as variables
* Iterators
* ES6 arrow syntax
* Let/const/var
* Block scope versus function scope
* Scope chain in functions/global
* PBV, PBR
* Slice, object.assign, spread operator
* Falsy data types

Take-Aways:

if you plan to use functions before they're defined, use function declarations
use let/const instead of var
pay attention to falsy values (different from Ruby)
get used to arrow functions
copy arrays/objects using the spread operator

Promises, and .then
Async/await
